## Introduction

This project is dedicated to testing and validating various types of cryptography utils in Java implementations in Java. It
showcases different algorithms and their usage, providing a practical insight into modern cryptography and security in Java
applications.

## Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) - Version 11 or higher.
* Maven - For managing dependencies and running the project.
* An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode for editing and running the Java
  files.
* Or simply run it in command line.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wallaceespindola/cryptography-utils-java.git

cd cryptography-utils-java
```

2. Build the project with Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

3. Running the main examples:

```bash
java -jar ./target/cryptography-utils-java.jar
```

4. You can also run the unit tests for each algorithm on your IDE at the path 'src/test/java'.
